## Questionable Content Scraper

This script downloads every strip from the Questionable Content webcomic, from the first one to whichever is the most current, puts them into an accompanying directory, and numbers them in order automatically.

UPDATE: This will now save its progress in downloading QC so that you can continuously update your directory with new QC comics. 

There is an error catcher to flag a page without comics and a way to keep track of progress in case you lose internet connection during a run of the scraper. 

# A note

If you're going to do this, and can afford to do so, you should absolutely give material support to the Jeph Jacques and the QC endeavour.  You can find the store [here](https://topatoco.com/collections/jeph-jacques) which sells great stuff, and you can find his patreon [here](https://www.patreon.com/jephjacques). Web-comics, and creative arts in general, are a precarious endeavour and you should support the people who do it however you can. If you can't, I understand, but if you ever can please try to do so. 

# Future plans

I originally said I wouldn't update this, but I have. I may do it again, but I think it has all the functionality it needs to work. 

Enjoy!
