## Questionable Content Scraper

This script downloads every strip from the Questionable Content webcomic, from the first one to whichever is the most current, puts them into an accompanying directory, and numbers them in order automatically.

It will also print out any strips that it had errors downloading, although on the test run that seemed to produce no errors.

# A note

If you're going to do this, and can afford to do so, consider buying something from the QC store: https://topatoco.com/collections/jeph-jacques They sell good stuff, and if you enjoy the strip so much you want every image from the strip it's worth supporting them financially.

# Future plans

Probably not going to touch this again. 

Enjoy!
